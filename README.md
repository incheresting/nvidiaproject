# My_Protein_Tracker_AI

This project shows the detection of the protein content for various food options. There is a data set with various foods including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and of course meats. Whether you are a gym rat obsessed with their macros, someone who's embracing the keto diet, or just someone who wants to know how much of what their eating, this AI can be helpful. For me, I hate having to go to google and have many tabs open trying to conflate information for the protein of my meal
